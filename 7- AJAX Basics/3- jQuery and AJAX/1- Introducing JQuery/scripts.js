/*
AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.

AJAX is not a programming language.

AJAX just uses a combination of:

A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)
JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)
*/ 

/*
How AJAX works:
1. Create an XMLHTTP Request Object
2. Create a Callback function (When server sends back the requests)
3. Open a request
4. Send the request
